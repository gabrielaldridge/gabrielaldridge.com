        <h2>
          Introducing the newest VR game in development, "MR Sports"! 🏀
          <br>
          Using hand tracking and the Meta Quest's passthrough feature (imagine your living room and not an endless black abyss), "MR Sports" will offer a highly immersive, intuitive, and interactive experience.
          <br>
          While you can't move in the game, it's designed to be played like an arcade game, giving you the chance to show off your skills and compete with friends.
          <br>
          And this is just the beginning. Keep an eye on "MR Sports" and get ready to experience your favourite sports like never before.
          <br>
          "MR Sports" is the product of months of research to determine how accessible and intuitive VR can be. With the use of hand tracking, there is no need for a first-time user to learn the layout of a controller. The passthrough feature also keeps the player aware of their surroundings, making them feel less vulnerable whilst also limiting motion sickness.
